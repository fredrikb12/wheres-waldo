## Reflections

This project was my first time utilizing a back-end, specifically Google's Firestore. It proved to be relatively straight-forward to do most of what was required, as their documentation had examples that could be adjusted to my particular needs most of the time. 

Building the front-end went more smoothly than previous projects, as my experience with React in general is growing. React router is becoming a good friend, as it allows for easy client-side routing and fast UI updates. 

All in all, it was one of the more challenging projects to date; the complexity of fetching from and posting to the back-end, dealing with relative character positions and user selections, and a relatively large front-end meant it was a sizable project from start to finish.
